Sandbox mode allow you mess around with features in separated environments so you can freely create and delete variables and code as needed in order to understand what is needed to create a functionality work, and not need to focus on how to integrate it with your main code nor need to remember to clean up the exact elements you created as a manner of exploration

It consists of 2 folders

- Sand: Is where you collect example code from various sources that approximates to what you want to achieve, trying to keep each in a separate folder with a short and descriptive name, for easy lookup. In this folder, you don't save code that you have modified
- Boxes: Are where you modify and test code from the Sand folder. It has other folders inside, each with a short and descriptive name indicating a feature you want to achieve.

The workflow is roughly as follows:

1. Collect code from various sources that approximates what you want to achieve and save each package as a separate unit (folder, zip, etc...) in the Sand folder

2. Define a feature you want to explore and create a folder in the Boxes folder with a short and descriptive name for that feature

3. Find relevant code in the Sand folder

4. Modify it to achieve the intended goal

5. The modifications are saved in the folder you created inside the Boxes folder

6. Based on what you learn here, you can integrate this feature to your main code

Bonus: If you can modularize that code at this stage and integrate that module in your main code, you're smooth sailing!
