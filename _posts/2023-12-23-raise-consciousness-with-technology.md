title: "How to design electrical technologies to raise human consciousness.\nOr 🤔 + 🛠️🔌 = 🧘⬆️"
---

🤔💡 + 🤔🛠️ + 🤔📱 = 🧘⬆️

Humanity deserves the **📚resources, 🤝 🏘️communities, 🧩🧱building blocks and 🛒products** that will accelerate its use of 🔌electrical 📱technologies to ⬆️raise its 🧘consciousness.

"⬆️Raising 🧘consciousness" could be though of as coming to a state where one is able to 🔨do whatever and ❤️feel however one deeply, truly wants.

People are already creating technologies taking into account certain requirements, like so:

![A Venn diagran visualizing that when providing a tool, designers have to contend with diverse requirements, which can be though of a overlapping circles. Any point in the whole area of the diagram would represent a potential solution. The truly desired solution would lie somewhere in the area where all circles overlap each other ](/assets/typical design.png)

Some specific example could be the following:

![A specific example visualizing that when creating a solution, three possibly desired requirements may be a given eefectivity or capacity to perform a given task, a given efficiency and a given aesthetic quality](/assets/design requirements example.png)

Considering how to provide a solution that increases consciousness would just require considering one more variable when designing:

![this is alt text](/assets/design with consciousness.png)

More broadly, all phases of the lifecycle of the technology can be designed to increase consiousness, like:

- 📔Defining requirements
- 📐Designing solutions
- 🏗️Building
- ✅Testing
- 🧠The experience of using the technology
- 🚶The experience when not using the technology directly
- 💀End of life

And finally, existing technologies can be modified to help increase consciousness, with new features or configuration options.
