### TL;DR

We want to create the **resources, communities, and example implementations** that will help accelerate humanity's use of electrical technologies to raise their consciousness.

People are already creating technologies taking into account certain requirements, like so:

Some specific examples could be the following:

Considering how to provide a solution that increases consciousness would just require considering one more variable when designing:

More broadly, all phases of the lifecycle of the technology can be designed to increase consiousness, like:

- Defining requirements
- Designing solutions
- Building
- Testing
- The experience of using the technology
- The experience when not using the technology directly
- End of life

And finally, existing technologies can be modified to help increase consciousness, with new features or configuration options.
